# 1. Use a while loop to print numbers 1-10:
#i = 0
#while i <= 9:
#	i+= 1
	#print(i)
# 2. Use a while loop to print the first 10 multiples of 24:
i = 0 
while i <= 24:
	#print(i)
	i += 10 
# 3. Use a while loop to find the average of these numbers:
numbers = [10,42,-2, 900,5,8,39]

total = 0
i = 0
while i < len(numbers):
	total += numbers[i]
	i+= 1

print(total)
average = total/len(numbers)

print(average)
	


#print(numbers[0])
