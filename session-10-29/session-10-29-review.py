# Welcome back!

# Reviewing While loops:
# Write code to print multiples of 5 from 45 to 90
i = 40
while i <= 85:
	i+= 5
	print(i)



# With your partner: discuss: What is a set? What is it good for?
# Write your response as a comment here:
#a set is similar to a list but instead the data isn't in order and rather dumped data 

# Create a variable called "myset" and put whatever you want in it:

myset = {11,2003,"november","Lynette","Jeem",8}

# Create a 2D numpy array of size 3x5 with numbers 1-15:

import numpy as np 
a = np.arange(1,16,1).reshape(3,5)
print(a)

# From your array, print the number 7:

print(a[1,1])

# Challenge: use while loop to print the following pattern:
# ****
# ***
# **
# *
