# Now, visualizing data
Our goal is to create two plots:

and 

![image](https://github.com/madesai22/ocean-ml/blob/master/images/BATS_ssh.png)

We are going to use the code we wrote last time as a starting point. There is a copy of it in this directory called 'visualizing_data.py'. 

We're going to make a plot from example code: plotting_numpy_arrays_example.py

Steps:
1. Locate and open plotting_numpy_arrays_example.py. Briefly read through it, and play with it if you want. 
2. Now open visualizing_data.py. On line 5, change the path to the path to your file. 
3. Start with the Global Ocean plot. In this order:
- [ ] Plot the data
- [ ] Add a title
- [ ] Label the axes
- [ ] Add a colorbar (code on line 66 to change the scale of the colorbar)
- [ ] Add the BATS region box
- [ ] Add the legend box
- [ ] Change the values of the x and y ticks to be the lat and lon 

If you finish, start making the BATS plot
